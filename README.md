# Loan Management System

This is a loan management system that allows you to manage customer information and loan data. It provides functionalities for determining customer eligibility, managing loan repayments, and performing various loan management operations.

## Project Structure

The project has the following file structure:

```
loan_management_system
├── data
│   ├── customers.csv
│   └── loans.csv
├── src
│   ├── customer.py
│   ├── loan.py
│   ├── eligibility.py
│   ├── repayment.py
│   └── utils.py
├── main.py
└── README.md
```

## Files

- `data/customers.csv`: This file contains the data for the customers of the loan management system. It stores information such as customer names, addresses, and contact details.

- `data/loans.csv`: This file contains the data for the loans in the loan management system. It stores information such as loan amounts, interest rates, and repayment schedules.

- `src/customer.py`: This file defines the `Customer` class, which represents a customer in the loan management system. It includes properties such as name, address, and contact details, as well as methods for retrieving and updating customer information.

- `src/loan.py`: This file defines the `Loan` class, which represents a loan in the loan management system. It includes properties such as loan amount, interest rate, and repayment schedule, as well as methods for calculating interest and managing loan payments.

- `src/eligibility.py`: This file contains functions for determining the eligibility of a customer for a loan. It may include functions that check credit scores, income levels, or other criteria to determine if a customer qualifies for a loan.

- `src/repayment.py`: This file contains functions for managing loan repayments. It may include functions for calculating monthly payments, generating repayment schedules, or handling late payments.

- `src/utils.py`: This file contains utility functions that can be used throughout the loan management system. It may include functions for reading and writing CSV files, formatting dates, or performing other common tasks.

- `main.py`: This file is the entry point of the loan management system. It may include code for interacting with the user, managing customer and loan data, and performing various operations related to loan management.

## Usage

To use the loan management system, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the `data/customers.csv` and `data/loans.csv` files are populated with the necessary data.

2. Run the `main.py` file to start the loan management system.

3. Follow the prompts and instructions provided by the system to perform various loan management operations, such as checking customer eligibility, managing loan repayments, and more.

4. Refer to the documentation and comments within the source code files for more detailed information on the system's functionalities and implementation.
